# Using an `.editorconfig` File in C# for Code Style and Analysis

The `.editorconfig` file is a powerful tool for enforcing consistent coding styles and configuring static code analysis across your C# projects. It enables teams to establish and maintain a unified coding standard, improving readability and maintainability of the codebase.

---

## **1. What is an `.editorconfig` File?**

An `.editorconfig` file is a plain text file used to define coding conventions for different file types in a project. It provides a centralized way to configure:
- Code style rules (e.g., indentation, spacing, naming conventions).
- Code analysis severity levels (e.g., warnings, errors).

Supported by IDEs such as Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, `.editorconfig` ensures consistent code formatting and analysis across development environments.

---

## **2. Creating an `.editorconfig` File**

1. Create a new file named `.editorconfig` at the root of your solution or repository.
2. Define rules within the file, typically grouped by file type or scope.

### **Sample `.editorconfig` File**
```editorconfig
# Top-level configuration
root = true

# Global settings for all files
[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true

# Specific settings for C# files
[*.cs]
dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true
csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all
csharp_indent_case_contents = true
csharp_prefer_simple_default_expression = true:suggestion

# Configure severity for specific analysis rules
# CA2000: Dispose objects before losing scope
# Set this rule as an error
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2000.severity = error

# S125: Sections of code should not be commented out
# Disable this rule
sonar_diagnostic.S125.severity = none
```

---

## **3. Sections of an `.editorconfig` File**

### **3.1 Global Settings**
Global settings apply to all files in the project:
```editorconfig
root = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```
- `root = true`: Specifies that this is the top-most `.editorconfig` file. Any `.editorconfig` files in parent directories are ignored.
- `indent_style`: Specifies the type of indentation (`space` or `tab`).
- `indent_size`: Defines the number of spaces per indentation level.
- `end_of_line`: Sets the line ending style (`lf`, `cr`, `crlf`).
- `charset`: Configures the character encoding (e.g., `utf-8`).

### **3.2 File-Specific Rules**
Rules can be scoped to specific file types using patterns:
```editorconfig
[*.cs]
dotnet_sort_system_directives_first = true
csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all
csharp_indent_case_contents = true
```

### **3.3 Configuring Severity Levels**
Static analysis rules can be customized to set their severity:
- `none`: Disable the rule.
- `silent`: Show the rule in the IDE but do not generate a warning or error.
- `suggestion`: Show a suggestion.
- `warning`: Mark as a warning.
- `error`: Treat as an error.

Example:
```editorconfig
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2000.severity = error
```
This configuration enforces the `CA2000` rule (disposing objects before losing scope) as an error.

**P.S.** Here's a sample [.editorconfig](https://gist.github.com/m-jovanovic/417b7d0a641d7dd7d1972550fba298db) file you can add to your projects and customize to fit your needs.

## **4. Common C# Code Style Settings**

### **4.1 New Line Preferences**
Control where new lines should appear:
```editorconfig
csharp_new_line_before_open_brace = all
```
Options:
- `none`: No new line before opening braces.
- `all`: New line before all opening braces (classes, methods, properties, etc.).

#### **Example**
Before applying the rule:
```csharp
public class MyClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
After applying the rule:
```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### **4.2 Indentation Rules**
```editorconfig
csharp_indent_case_contents = true
```
Specifies whether the contents of a `case` statement in a `switch` block should be indented.

#### **Example**
Before applying the rule:
```csharp
switch (value)
{
case 1:
Console.WriteLine("One");
break;
}
```
After applying the rule:
```csharp
switch (value)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("One");
        break;
}
```

### **4.3 Simplification Rules**
```editorconfig
csharp_prefer_simple_default_expression = true:suggestion
```
Enforces the use of simplified default expressions:
- `default` instead of `default(T)`.

#### **Example**
Before applying the rule:
```csharp
int number = default(int);
```
After applying the rule:
```csharp
int number = default;
```

## **5. Using `.editorconfig` in CI/CD Pipelines**

To ensure `.editorconfig` rules are enforced during builds, integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline using the `dotnet format` tool:

### **Azure DevOps Example**
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.x'

- script: |
    dotnet format --verify-no-changes
  displayName: 'Run .editorconfig Formatting Check'
```
This pipeline step verifies that all code adheres to the `.editorconfig` rules.

---

## **6. Best Practices for `.editorconfig`**

1. **Define a Baseline**: Start with default rules and customize as needed.
2. **Keep It at the Root**: Place the `.editorconfig` file in the root directory of your solution to ensure it applies to all projects.
3. **Integrate into Builds**: Use tools like `dotnet format` or static analysis in CI/CD pipelines to enforce rules.
4. **Document Exceptions**: Clearly document disabled rules and justifications.

---

## **7. Conclusion**
The `.editorconfig` file is an essential tool for maintaining code consistency in C#. By defining coding standards and customizing analysis rules, teams can improve collaboration, maintainability, and code quality. Integrate `.editorconfig` into your projects and pipelines to ensure adherence to these standards across your development lifecycle.
